# NestJS Framework Overview

NestJS is an open-source Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side apps and APIs.

### Some of the main features:

- Modular Architecture: NestJS is based on the modular architecture pattern, allowing developers to create reusable code and organize their applications into logical [modules](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules).

- Dependency Injection: NestJS uses dependency injection to manage the creation and lifecycle of objects. This makes it easier to write scalable and maintainable applications by allowing developers to easily create and manage complex object graphs.

- Middleware: NestJS supports middleware, which can be used to add functionality to an application's request/response cycle. Middleware can be used for tasks such as logging, error handling, and authentication.

- API Development: NestJS provides proper support for [REST APIs](https://restfulapi.net/), [GraphQL](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start), [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) and [gRPC](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/grpc#overview).

- Database tools like [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) for entity management and CRUD operations are avaialble for easy integration.

- Built-in utilities like [guards](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards), [pipes](https://docs.nestjs.com/pipes), [interceptors](https://docs.nestjs.com/interceptors) and exception filters for cross-cutting concerns like security, loggin, error handling, etc. are available in the framework.

- [OpenAPI (Swagger)](https://www.openapis.org/): This makes it easy to document the API and test it.

## NestJS vs Express

| NestJS | Express |
| --- | --- |
| NestJS follows more of an MVC architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns between controllers, services and repositories. | Express is more loosely coupled and focused only on routing functionality.|
| NestJS has dependency injection built into its core using decorators. | Express does not have built-in DI, requiring external libraries like Inversify.|
| NestJS encourages building modular applications using modules that group related functionality together.| Express takes more of a monolithic approach.|
| NestJS uses class-based routing where controllers define routes.| Express uses more lightweight function-based route handlers.|
| NestJS includes classes for validation/sanitization out of the box. | Express does not have built-in validation/sanitization.|
| NestJS provides things like Guards, Interceptors, Pipes out of the box. | Express relies on middleware for cross-cutting concerns.|
| NestJS integrates ORMs seamlessly via modules.| Express requires manual queries usually.|

So NestJS abstracts away boilerplate and provides structure, while Express provides raw routing capabilities. NestJS can be viewed as a higher-level framework built upon the lower-level Express.

### Use Cases:
- Large or complex applications: Nest's structural features like modules, dependency injection and OOP patterns help organize large codebases and divide code into logical components. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain as an app grows.

- API-focused projects: Nest is optimized for building REST/GraphQL APIs. Features like built-in routing, controllers, interceptors and guards help create robust, scalable APIs more easily.

- Migrating from other frameworks: Nest's familiar OOP concepts adapt well to developers coming from Angular, .NET or Java backgrounds. Typescript also provides compile-time checking.

- Microservices architectures: Nest's modular approach to code organization lends itself well to dividing an app into independent microservices. DI further decouples services.

### Conclusion:
I would recommend using NestJS for new projects, especially if we are building a REST API or GraphQL API. It provides a lot of features out of the box and is easy to use. It also has a large community and good documentation.
